## What is it?

This is the front-end part of an imaginary pizzeria. It has two different goals, works as a webshop for customers to order pizza and for employees it works as a simple ERP to help workflow.

At the moment there are five different roles:

- manager
- cook
- delivery guy
- customer
- anonymous

Based on the authenticated role front-end shows different information, for example manager can see every active orders while cooks can only see the orders assigned to them.
